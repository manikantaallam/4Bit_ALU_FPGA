Can do the following things 
OPC      Operations
---      -----------
1  ----> No Operation
2  ----> Comparision
3  ----> Or Logic
4  ----> Shift Left
5  ----> Rotate Right
6  ----> Addition
7  ----> Subtraction
8  ----> Multiplication

1. Currernt one costs B number of clock cycles for each multiplication operation: it would be not that good approach.

2. There is another version still in progress v1.1 with without any cycle cost for Multiplication. Will be commited after a few days.
